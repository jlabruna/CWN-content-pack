# Changelog

## 0.10.2

- Fixed weapon-sheet rendering when the optional `harbour-city-stories` or CWN
  Content Pack flag scopes are not active. Family metadata is now read safely
  from the Item's stored flags without asking Foundry to validate an inactive
  package scope.
- Added a regression test for inactive optional flag scopes.

## 0.10.1

- Fixed the Weapon Family field failing to appear on SWNR 2.3.x weapon sheets
  by targeting the outer Ammo Type resource container used by the ammunition
  grid.
- Restored the GM-only Advanced SWNR Compatibility section and its Native Ammo
  Type control.

## 0.10.0

- Added centralized Weapon Family resolution from Combat Enhancements
  overrides, optional Content Pack metadata, and recognized legacy base-weapon
  flags.
- Added Magazine Family resolution from Combat Enhancements and optional
  Content Pack metadata.
- Replaced the normal weapon-sheet Ammo Type presentation with Weapon Family,
  including known choices, custom slug keys, an Unassigned state, and read-only
  presentation when editing is not permitted.
- Preserved Native Ammo Type in a GM-only Advanced SWNR Compatibility section.
- Added GM Only, Item Owners, and Nobody Weapon Family editing modes, enforced
  by both the sheet and `preUpdateItem`.
- Added optional exact-family physical-magazine reload automation, enabled by
  default.
- Added partial magazine transfer, safe depleted-magazine deletion, and stale
  selected-ammunition cleanup.
- Accepted both Readied and Stowed magazines while deliberately ignoring
  location.
- Preserved native SWNR reload behavior for untagged weapons and when exact
  magazine automation is disabled.
- Added Node test coverage, repeatable release staging, and a tag-driven GitHub
  Actions release build.

## 0.9.0

- Connected Network Console program requests to SWNR cyberdeck Actors.
- Run a Program now finds cyberdecks linked to hackers controlled by the
  requesting player.
- Players can only choose Verbs and Subjects actually loaded on the selected
  cyberdeck.
- Incompatible Verb and Subject target types are rejected before a request is
  sent.
- GM requests identify the hacker, cyberdeck, prepared program, Access cost,
  check modifier, and selected network node.
- Program checks, Access spending, CPU use, and program effects remain manual.

## 0.8.1

- Fixed a mismatched Handlebars block that prevented the Network Console window
  from rendering when opened from either launcher.

## 0.8.0

- Added an opt-in experimental Network Console for visualizing CWN networks.
- GMs can create multiple networks, set Security difficulty and server class,
  and add device nodes, connections, hidden connections, and Barriers.
- GMs can reveal individual nodes and connections to players while retaining
  private GM notes in a GM-only Journal Entry.
- Players receive a sanitized persistent view containing only revealed network
  information.
- Added CWN-labelled action requests such as Jack In, Move Nodes, Look for
  Hidden Connections, Run a Program, Copy File, and Issue Command.
- Player requests notify the GM but do not yet make checks, spend Access,
  consume CPU, or validate prepared Verbs and Subjects.
- Added a world setting to enable or disable the Network Console. It defaults
  to disabled and requires a reload when changed.
- Included an authorization field in the saved network schema for future
  designated-player sharing; v0.8.0 shares revealed information with all
  players.

## 0.7.0

- Added optional, target-specific automation for CWN's Prone attack modifiers.
- Melee attacks made by a prone attacker now take a -4 modifier.
- Attacks against an adjacent prone target gain +2; distant ranged attacks
  against a prone target take -2.
- Prone state and adjacency are captured when the attack is rolled, so later
  condition changes do not alter an existing chat card.
- Suppressive Fire now pre-confirms the brace-or-prone requirement when the
  shooter has the Prone status.
- Token movement and standing up remain manual.

## 0.6.2

- Corrected the Suppressive Fire confirmation to state that the weapon must be
  braced against a solid support or the gunner must have gone prone.
- Corrected the cancellation warning to use the same rules-accurate wording.

## 0.6.1

- Added labelled modifier breakdowns to expanded Suppressive Fire weapon-damage
  rolls.
- Expanded Evasion Save rolls now show the die, Evasion target, and save result.
- Expanded Trauma rolls now show the Trauma Die, target-specific Trauma Target,
  and whether the roll produced a Trauma Hit.

## 0.6.0

- Added **Use Suppressive Fire** to eligible SWNR weapon attack dialogs.
- Burst Fire and Suppressive Fire now both start unticked on every attack and
  are mutually exclusive.
- Added a temporary 90-degree cone aimed through exactly one targeted token.
- Limited affected targets to the weapon's normal range and non-hidden tokens
  inside that cone.
- Added a confirmation window for the required braced or mounted state and
  manual hard-cover exclusions.
- Suppressive Fire now spends two rounds, rolls weapon damage once, and rolls
  each uncovered target's Evasion Save separately.
- Failed Evasion Saves take half damage rounded up and receive an individual
  Trauma Die check; successful saves and hard-cover targets take no damage.
- Added a dedicated Suppressive Fire chat card and GM-only damage action that
  delegates Damage Reduction, Soak, HP, and defeat handling to SWNR.

## 0.5.1

- Fixed modifier breakdowns remaining visible when their Foundry roll details
  were collapsed.
- Modifier breakdowns now open and close with their corresponding dice tooltip.

## 0.5.0

- Added labelled modifier breakdowns inside expanded weapon attack rolls.
- Attack details itemise the attack die, Burst Fire, manual modifier, character
  attack bonus, weapon bonus, attribute modifier, skill rank, and total.
- Damage details itemise weapon damage, Burst Fire, attribute modifier, damage
  bonus, and total.
- Trauma rolls and Trauma damage now explain their die or multiplier components.
- Breakdown values are captured at roll time and do not change if the actor or
  weapon is edited later.

## 0.4.0

- Successful attacks that also beat a target's Trauma Target are now displayed
  as a blue **TRAUMA HIT!** instead of a standard green **HIT**.
- Trauma outcomes are determined separately for every target.
- Misses and out-of-range attacks remain misses regardless of the Trauma Die.

## 0.3.1

- Fixed NPC Soak incorrectly stacking from multiple active body-armour suits.
- Soak now comes from the single highest active body armor plus active armor
  accessories, such as Absorption Plates.
- NPC armor and accessories must now be both Readied and Equipped to provide
  protection.
- Stowed NPC armor cannot be equipped from the NPC armor list, and changing an
  armor item's carried location automatically unequips it.

## 0.3.0

- Added NPC armor defense calculation for SWNR's CWN mode.
- Ticked NPC armor now determines ranged and melee AC, using the highest active
  body armor and active shield bonuses.
- Manual Base AC and Melee AC remain the NPC's fallback defenses.
- Only ticked NPC armor contributes Soak and Trauma Target protection.
- Added a world setting allowing GMs to disable NPC armor automation.

## 0.2.0

- Added a GM-only **Apply damage to HIT targets** action to attack cards.
- Applies damage to every target captured at attack time that the Target Check
  marks as a hit, without requiring those tokens to remain selected.
- Compares the rolled Trauma Die with each target's modified Trauma Target and
  applies either normal damage or multiplied Trauma damage independently.
- Uses SWNR's existing health application so Damage Reduction, Soak, HP,
  defeated status, and floating damage numbers continue to work normally.
- Restores the user's original controlled-token selection after damage is
  applied and records completed application on the message to discourage
  accidental double damage.
- Added natural 1 automatic misses and natural 20 automatic hits to Target Check.

## 0.1.1

- Fixed weapon classification and range lookup for unlinked NPC tokens.
- The module now prefers the attacking token's synthetic actor and embedded
  weapon data over the original world actor.

## 0.1.0

- Added target-aware melee and ranged AC checks.
- Added token distance measurement and CWN ranged-weapon range bands.
- Added normal, extreme (−2), and out-of-range results.
