# CWN Combat Enhancements

A minimal Foundry VTT v13 companion module for **Cities Without Number** games
running on **Systems Without Number Redux (SWNR) 2.3.0**.

## Current scope

- Captures the user's targeted tokens when an SWNR weapon attack is rolled.
- Detects melee attacks through `weapon.system.isMelee`.
- Uses `actor.system.meleeAc` for melee and `actor.system.ac` for ranged attacks.
- Measures token-center distance with Foundry's grid path measurement.
- Treats SWNR weapon ranges as meters and converts common scene units.
- Applies CWN's Prone attack modifiers using condition state captured when the
  attack is rolled. Touching or diagonally touching token footprints count as
  adjacent.
- Applies CWN's −2 modifier beyond normal range and up to maximum range.
- Reports hit, miss, or out of range separately for each target.
- Highlights successful Trauma hits separately in blue. A high Trauma Die never
  changes a missed or out-of-range attack into a Trauma hit.
- Adds labelled modifier breakdowns to expanded attack, damage, Trauma, and
  Trauma-damage rolls.
- Adds explicit Burst Fire and Suppressive Fire choices to eligible weapon
  attack dialogs. Both choices start unticked and cannot be selected together.
- Resolves CWN Suppressive Fire with a 90-degree cone, normal-range limit,
  two-round ammunition cost, hard-cover exclusions, Evasion Saves, half damage
  rounded up, and separate Trauma checks for each struck target.
- Keeps exact enemy AC hidden from players by default; GMs always see it.
- Gives the GM one **Apply damage to HIT targets** action on attack cards with a
  completed damage roll.
- Applies damage to every attack-time target marked HIT, even when the weapon
  would ordinarily attack only one target. Target selection is treated as the
  user's declaration of every intended damage recipient.
- Compares the attack's Trauma Die against each target's modified Trauma Target
  and applies either normal or multiplied Trauma damage independently.
- Delegates actual health changes to SWNR so Damage Reduction, Soak, HP, defeated
  status, and floating damage numbers retain the system's standard behavior.
- Calculates NPC ranged AC, melee AC, Soak, and Trauma protection from armor
  that is both Readied and Equipped. Manual NPC AC remains the fallback when
  active armor does not improve it.
- Includes an optional experimental **Network Console** for mapping CWN network
  nodes, connections, hidden connections, Barriers, and visible network
  contents. It is disabled by default.
- Adds Weapon Family metadata to SWNR weapon sheets without overwriting the
  native Ammo Type field.
- Optionally reloads family-aware weapons from a selected, actor-owned physical
  magazine with the exact same family, preserving partial magazines and deleting
  depleted magazine Items.

Ordinary attacks continue to use SWNR's original rolls and loaded-ammunition
expenditure. The optional magazine feature only replaces the actor-sheet reload
action for family-aware weapons. Suppressive Fire has its own rules workflow and
spends two rounds. Hard cover is selected manually in its confirmation window.

## Install on The Forge

Install the module using this manifest URL:

```text
https://github.com/jlabruna/CWN-combat-enhancements/releases/latest/download/module.json
```

Then enable **CWN Combat Enhancements** in the world's Manage Modules screen and
ensure SWNR's **CWN Armor** setting is enabled so melee AC is derived.

For a manual Forge import, upload the versioned
`cwn-combat-enhancements-v0.10.2.zip` release asset. The ZIP must contain
`module.json` at its root.

For development testing, target one or more tokens, control the attacker's token,
and roll a weapon from that actor's sheet. Use a scene whose distance units are
meters, feet, yards, kilometres, or miles.

## SWNR 2.3.0 integration notes

- Attack entry point: `module/data/items/item-weapon.mjs`, `SWNWeapon.rollAttack()`.
- Weapon dialog entry point: `SWNWeapon.roll()` and
  `templates/dialogs/roll-attack.hbs`.
- Attack card: `templates/chat/attack-roll.hbs`.
- Card linkage: `data-actor-id` and `data-item-id` on `.chat-card.item-card`.
- Attack roll: first roll on the resulting `ChatMessage` (`message.rolls[0]`).
- Weapon item type: `weapon`.
- Attack classification: `weapon.system.isMelee`.
- Range fields: `weapon.system.range.normal` and `.max`.
- Fire-mode fields: `weapon.system.ammo.burst` and `.suppress`.
- Character Evasion Save: `actor.system.save.evasion`; NPC Evasion Save:
  `actor.system.saves`.
- Base/derived AC schema: `module/data/actors/base-actor.mjs`.
- Character AC derivation: `module/data/actors/actor-character.mjs`.
- Ranged AC: `actor.system.ac`; melee AC: `actor.system.meleeAc`.
- Weapon sheet: `templates/item/attribute-parts/weapon.hbs`.
- Native ammunition source: `weapon.system.ammo.current`.
- Loaded rounds: `weapon.system.ammo.value/max`.
- Count-based magazine rounds: `item.system.uses.value/max`, with
  `item.system.uses.consumable === "count"`.
- Actor-sheet reload action: `SWNActorSheet.DEFAULT_OPTIONS.actions.reload`,
  originally inherited from `SWNBaseSheet._onReload()`.

## Weapon Families and physical magazines

Weapon Family is semantic compatibility metadata, not a displayed-name match.
Family keys are lowercase slugs such as `combat-rifle` or `heavy-pistol`.

The module resolves a weapon family in this order:

1. `flags["cwn-combat-enhancements"].weaponFamily`
2. `flags["cwn-content-pack"].weaponFamily`
3. Recognized legacy
   `flags["harbour-city-stories"].baseWeapon` values through a controlled map
4. No family, which preserves native SWNR behavior

Magazine family resolution uses:

1. `flags["cwn-combat-enhancements"].magazineFamily`
2. `flags["cwn-content-pack"].magazineFamily`

The **Weapon Family Editing** world setting controls whether the override is
editable by the GM only (default), Item owners, or nobody. The permission is
enforced on both the sheet and `preUpdateItem`; disabling an input is not the
only protection.

The **Enable exact magazine automation** world setting defaults to enabled.
When enabled, a family-aware weapon can reload only from its selected,
actor-owned `count` consumable with the exact same Magazine Family and at least
one round. Readied and Stowed magazines are both accepted; location is
deliberately ignored.

Reloading transfers only the lesser of the weapon's missing rounds and the
selected magazine's remaining rounds. A partial magazine remains a distinct
Item. A depleted magazine is set to zero, its stale weapon reference is cleared,
and the embedded Item is deleted. Empty magazines are not created, magazines
are never merged, and this module does not provide refilling or Encumbrance
rules.

CWN Content Pack integration is optional. Untagged weapons and worlds with exact
magazine automation disabled use SWNR's native ammunition source selection and
reload logic. GMs can still find **Native Ammo Type** under **Advanced SWNR
Compatibility** on the weapon sheet.

## Experimental Network Console

Enable **Experimental Network Console** under **Configure Settings > CWN Combat
Enhancements**, then reload the world. Open it from the network icon in the
Token controls or from the module's settings submenu.

The v0.8.0 prototype follows CWN's network vocabulary:

- networks contain device **nodes** joined by **connections**;
- **Barriers** protect connections rather than acting as nodes;
- Demons and watchdogs occupy nodes, and datafiles are node contents;
- networks record their Security difficulty and primary server class;
- connections and nodes can be hidden until the GM reveals them.

The full network is kept in a GM-only Journal Entry. Players receive a sanitized
projection containing only revealed nodes, revealed connections, and
player-facing details. Private GM notes are never included in that projection.

Players can select a revealed node and send CWN-labelled requests to the GM,
including **Jack In**, **Move Nodes**, **Look for Hidden Connections**, **Run a
Program**, **Copy File**, and **Issue Command**.

**Run a Program** finds SWNR cyberdeck Actors linked to a hacker controlled by
the requesting player. The player can only choose Verbs and Subjects embedded
on that cyberdeck, which are the programs prepared on it. The request is blocked
when the Verb's allowed target types do not match the selected Subject. The GM
receives the hacker, cyberdeck, combined program, Access cost, check modifier,
and selected node.

These requests are still a visualization and table-communication aid. The
prototype does not yet:

- roll Program checks or resolve defensive programs;
- spend Access or CPU;
- automate Alert the Network;
- limit a published network to a designated player.

The saved network schema already reserves an authorization list so
designated-player sharing can be added without redesigning saved networks.

## Known limitations

- Results require the attacker's token and targets to be on the currently viewed
  scene when the card renders. Otherwise distance is marked unavailable.
- Unknown/custom scene distance units cannot be converted to weapon-range meters.
- Melee attacks select melee AC and report distance, but v0.1 does not enforce a
  reach limit because SWNR's melee compendium entries contain generic range data.
- The module recognizes SWNR's existing attack-card HTML because SWNR 2.3.0 does
  not attach weapon/target metadata to every attack message. A future SWNR card
  markup change may require a compatibility update.
- Multi-level/elevation distance and wall/line-of-sight checks are not included.
- Prone affects Target Check attack totals, but this module does not restrict
  token movement or spend the Move action required to stand.
- Weapon-sheet and reload integration targets SWNR 2.3.x. If SWNR changes the
  weapon template or `SWNActorSheet.DEFAULT_OPTIONS.actions.reload`, the module
  logs a compatibility warning and leaves the affected integration unpatched.
- Physical magazine Items are expected to be supplied by a content module or
  created by the user. Version 0.10.2 does not create or migrate weapons or
  magazines.

## Suppressive Fire workflow

1. Control the firing token and target exactly one token to aim the cone.
2. Roll a weapon whose **Suppressive Fire** box is enabled on its item sheet.
3. Leave Burst Fire unticked and tick **Use Suppressive Fire**.
4. The module places a temporary 90-degree cone from the shooter toward the aim
   target and finds every non-hidden token inside the weapon's normal range.
5. In the confirmation window, confirm that the weapon is braced against a
   solid support or that the gunner has gone prone, and tick **Hard cover**
   beside any protected targets.
6. The module spends two rounds, rolls weapon damage once, and rolls an Evasion
   Save separately for every uncovered token. Failed saves take half damage,
   rounded up. Every failed target gets its own Trauma Die and Trauma Target
   comparison.
7. The GM can use **Apply Suppressive Damage** on the resulting chat card. SWNR
   still processes Damage Reduction, Soak, HP, defeat, and floating numbers.

Suppressive Fire does not roll to hit or compare AC. The temporary cone is an
aiming preview; this release does not automatically determine hard cover from
walls. If a custom actor has no readable Evasion Save, the card marks that
target for manual resolution and does not apply damage automatically.

## Target-aware damage behavior

- The damage action is GM-only because it can update NPC actors.
- It appears when SWNR rolls damage on the original attack card. If the world is
  configured to roll damage later in a separate chat message, use SWNR's normal
  damage buttons for that attack.
- Every captured target marked HIT receives damage. The module intentionally
  does not restrict ordinary weapons to one recipient; targeting multiple tokens
  is treated as an explicit request to apply that attack to all successful ones.
- Targets marked MISS or OUT OF RANGE never receive damage from the action.
- Each target is processed separately through SWNR's health helper so one
  target's Damage Reduction or Soak cannot reduce another target's damage.
- After a successful application, the chat message records that damage was
  applied and replaces the action with a completed summary. SWNR's original
  buttons remain available for GM corrections or exceptional rules.

## Changes

### 0.10.2

- Prevented inactive optional Content Pack and legacy flag scopes from aborting
  weapon-sheet rendering.
- Added a regression test for family resolution when an optional flag scope is
  unavailable.

### 0.10.1

- Fixed the Weapon Family field failing to appear because the sheet integration
  targeted SWNR's nested Ammo Type form group instead of its direct grid child.
- Restored the GM-only Advanced SWNR Compatibility section on weapon sheets.

### 0.10.0

- Added centralized Weapon Family and Magazine Family resolution with optional
  CWN Content Pack and controlled legacy metadata support.
- Replaced the ordinary weapon-sheet Ammo Type presentation with a
  permission-controlled Weapon Family field while retaining native Ammo Type in
  a GM-only advanced compatibility section.
- Added optional exact-family magazine selection and partial-round transfer.
- Depleted embedded magazine Items are deleted after their remaining rounds and
  the weapon's stale source reference are safely updated.
- Added automated family, permission, compatibility, and reload-calculation
  tests plus a focused Foundry manual regression checklist.

  Suppressive Fire flag.
- Added mutually exclusive Burst Fire and Suppressive Fire choices, both
  unticked by default on every attack dialog.
